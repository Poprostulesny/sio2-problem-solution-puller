How to use

Requirements:
1. Python libraries:
    -selenium
    -json
    -config
    -base64
2. Microsoft Edge webdrivers https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver?form=MA13LH


Other noteworthy things:
1. If the program gives an error that a given file doesn't exist, then adjusting time limit in 227 line in utils.py might help, as the time that a previous command requires varies with internet speed and computer speed
2. It is possible to use Chrome instead of Edge with tweaks at lines 17 and 26 in main.py
